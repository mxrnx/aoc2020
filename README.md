These are my answers for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.org/) in Arc. If you want to run them:
1. Create a subfolder lib with (a link to) the standard library's `strings.arc` and [Conrad Barski's `re.arc`](http://www.lisperati.com/arc/regex.html).
2. Start an Arc repl from the repository root and `(load "aoc.arc")`
3. Now you can use `(run day part example?)`, with `day` and `part` being the number of the day and part to run, and `example?` absent or `nil` to use the normal input, or `t` to use the example input.
